##  project description  
this project demonstrates core skills in python and numpy through three parts:  

1. **task 1:** python data structures & control flow  
   - worked with dictionaries, lists, and functions  
   - processed student performance data and generated a report  

2. **task 2:** numpy arrays & operations  
   - created, sliced, and analyzed arrays  
   - performed mathematical and statistical operations on simulated data  

3. **task 3:** applied data analysis  
   - generated and cleaned a 3-dimensional dataset of user fitness activity  
   - analyzed behavior patterns, temporal trends, correlations, and goal achievement  
   - produced insights and recommendations based on simulated data

##  summary of findings (task 3)

* average daily steps and calories gradually increased month to month.
* users with higher active minutes consistently burned more calories.
* younger users showed higher variability in activity levels.
* about 25 % of users met all daily fitness goals on more than 80 % of days.
* steps and active minutes showed strong positive correlation (~0.9).
* weekend activity was slightly higher than weekday averages.
